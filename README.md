# my_website
My website highlighting my career

This project is based on The Odin Project's Recipes Project, but I wanted to make it into something personally useful, and flesh it out to challenge myself on what I'd already learned before I started TOP.

The first step that I took was to copy over boilerplate HTML code from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/basic-html5-template-boilerplate-code-example/.  There isn't too much value in reinventing the wheel here, and using a boilerplate HTML template ensures that the essentials are covered.

I want visitors to land on the main page, which presents an overview of my career (companies I've worked, professional societies I belong to, milestone projects I've completed, etc.  From there, users can navigate to pages that expand in more detail on the various highlights from the main page.  I want to incorporate navbars, breadcrumb navigation, and search to make things easy to find.
